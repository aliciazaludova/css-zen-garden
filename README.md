# CSS Zen Garden
## Description
This project's objective was to create a static HTML page that puts CSS skills to work. The goal was to create as much of a likeness as possible (within time constraints) to a page of our selection on the site [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/). [Here is the design I chose to replicate.](http://www.csszengarden.com/143/) This was our first assignment in my cohort at NSS.
